# YOLOv8 Leaf Segmentation (REX)

## Overview
A computer vision system for precise leaf instance segmentation, specifically designed for the REX gantry robot. The system utilizes a custom-trained YOLOv8 model to provide accurate leaf detection and segmentation, enabling automated robotic grasping and manipulation tasks in agricultural settings.

## Features
- Real-time leaf instance segmentation
- High-confidence detection (>0.90 average confidence)
- Multi-leaf tracking with unique instance IDs
- Precise contour generation for each leaf
- Automated statistics generation (area, perimeter)
- Integration with robotic grasping systems
- Support for stereo camera inputs

## System Requirements
- CUDA-capable GPU (tested on NVIDIA GPUs)
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch 2.0+

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/YoloV8Seg-REX.git
cd YoloV8Seg-REX

# Create conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate yolo-v8

# Download pre-trained weights
wget https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IfbEu46vCMeQ-PtjwJ3RlUAobK5jPzQu/view?usp=drive_link -O weights/large_best.pt
```

## Quick Start

```python
from src.inference.segmentation import LeafSegmentation

# Initialize segmenter with pre-trained weights
segmenter = LeafSegmentation(model_path="weights/large_best.pt")

# Process image with visualization
results = segmenter.segment_image(
    "path/to/image.jpg",
    visualize=True,
    output_json=True
)

# Access detailed results
masks = results['masks']           # Individual leaf masks
scores = results['scores']         # Confidence scores
stats = results['leaf_stats']      # Area, perimeter, etc.
viz = results['visualization']     # Visualization image
```

## Technical Implementation
